Angular Code Review:
    Angular-ize: we need to thin our controllers big time,
    Only declare $scope variables if they really need to be there.
    move all localstorage stuff to its own file




THINGS TO ADD

    P1:
    Multiple animation - SAM
    Templates
    Error message if article chosen is interactive or other

    P2:
    Fix itext
    Smarter generation? Algorithm - definitely less images
    Share buttons
    Make it easier to create rectangles

    P3:
    Change multiple slides?
    download w/article name as filename.
    quotes with overlays by default
